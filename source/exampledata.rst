Example Data
============

We provide a group of test data to test the software, and the data 
was also used in `[11] <reference.html#id11>`_ .

Basic source for Bash (B-shell) and Python
------------------------------------------

If you want to use script for batch processing, we strongly recommend using Python, 
since it has nice grammar style and is portable for cross platform. 

The Python is easy to learn for basic use as a script language, 
although its powerful functions largely depend on 3rd party packages. To this 
end, we have several suggestions to begin with it. First, take a couple of hours 
to go through the primary Python grammars. There is a large bundle of free 
but kind tutorials from internet (Google “Python tutorial” or related keywords). 
You can choose the websites according to your preference. If you are a newbie of 
Python, don’t think about which version is appropriate for you and just use 
the latest version (Python>3.0) (In the current stage, you only need to note 
the difference of “print” function in different versions, which I think is not 
a smart change from version 3.0); and don’t waste money to buy a book since 
the materials from the internet are largely beyond your capacity. Several 
tutorial links are listed here:

If you prefer to use shell script, like Bash, you can also find some 
entrances for tutorials. The shell script itself is easy to follow and it is 
a powerful tool to concatenate the underlying execution functions. It should be 
noted that the Bash script is only for * NUX system, so it is not 
suitable form cross-platforms. Several tutorial links are listed here:
